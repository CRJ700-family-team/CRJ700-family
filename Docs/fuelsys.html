		<h3>Overview</h3>

		<p>
		 The CRJ700 series aircrafts have three fuel tanks: left wing, right wing 
		 and center tank for long range flights. 
		 Electrical fuel pumps, engine driven pumps and ejectors 
		 will supply fuel to the engines and transfer fuel between the tanks. 
		 The collector tanks are not modelled as they do not become visible in the simulation.
		</p>
		<p>
		 A fuel computer controls the tanks and fuel transfer. 
		 Fuel will be automatically transfer from the centre tank to the wing 
		 tanks to keep the wing tanks level between 93% to 97%.
		 The powered crossflow pump is used to balance fuel between left 
		 and right wing tank automatically. 
		 The crew can override this by selecting manual cross flow and selecting 
		 either to left or to right direction.
		</p>
		<p>
		In case of a failure of the automatic fuel system, the crew can select 
		the gravity xflow open to balance the fuel between left and right wing.
		</p>
		<p class="warn">
		The EICAS page for the fuel system is not yet implemented.
		</p>
		<h3>Normal operation</h3>
		<p>
		On the OHP you will find some switchlights to control and monitor the fuel system.
		Before engine start, the two fuel pumps must be armed. The will activate then 
		as needed automatically.
		For take of, the automatic xflow must be deactivated by selecting manual xflow 
		(NOT gravity xflow, which must be closed for take off!).
