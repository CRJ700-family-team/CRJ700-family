		<h1>CRJ700 Series pneumatic (bleed air) system</h1>
		<p id="author">	Written by D-JSB in 06/2016	</p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>

		<p>
		The pneumatic bleed air system provides hot pressurized air for the cabin 
		air condition, engine starters and anti-ice system. This air can be 
		generated by the engines, the APU or an external source while parked on ground.
		</p>
		<p>
		Under normal situations, bleed air is managed automatically. In case of 
		non-normal situations, the pilot can use the controls on the OHP for manual
		configuration of the system.
		</p>
		<p class="warn">
		Bleed air system faults (e.g. bleed air leak) are not implemented yet.
		</p>
		<p class="warn">
		The EICAS page for the pneumatic system is not yet implemented.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the OHP you find a section to control bleed air system.
		You can leave the system in automatic mode, unless you need to use the 
		external source on ground. In that case, you must select the bleed valves 
		closed to avoid damage to the APU and engines.
		In manual mode you can select the bleed source and open or close the 
		isolation valve to divided the system into a left and right section.
